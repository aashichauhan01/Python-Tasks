To-do List Application:-This Python script uses tkinter to create a simple To-Do List application. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and view all tasks. Task management functions include error handling for task selection and input validation. The interface includes entry fields, buttons, and a listbox for task display.

Calculator:-This Python script creates a simple GUI calculator using tkinter library. It defines functions for button operations (clear, number input, and calculation), and sets up tkinter widgets (Entry for display, Buttons for digits, operators, and functions). Buttons trigger respective functions with lambda expressions. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and evaluates expressions using Python's eval() function.

Password Generator:-This Python script generates a random password based on user-defined criteria: number of alphabets, numbers, and special characters. It uses `random.choice()` to pick characters from predefined sets of alphabets, numbers, and special symbols. The characters are shuffled and concatenated into a final password string, which is then displayed to the user.

Rock Paper Scissors:-This Python script creates a Rock Paper Scissors game using tkinter GUI. It allows users to start the game, play rounds against the computer, and shows results dynamically. After 5 rounds, it displays the final score and offers an option to reset or exit the game.

Contact Book:-This Python script utilizes tkinter to create a Contact Book application. It allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts. Each function opens a separate window for respective operations, with input validation and feedback messages using tkinter's messagebox. The UI includes buttons and entry fields for interaction and data input/output.
